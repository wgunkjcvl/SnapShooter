## Limitations of Amazon's Product Advertising API

Many developers wonder why not use the Amazon Product Advertising API for product scraping. Here are some common limitations:

1. **Affiliate Quotas**: Amazon requires affiliate sales to maintain API access. If you fail to generate sales within a specific timeframe, your API key might be revoked.
2. **Rate Limits**: The API enforces strict limits, starting at one call per second, which can increase only after significant affiliate sales.
3. **Terms of Service Restrictions**: The API comes with strict terms that limit how the retrieved data can be used.
4. **Complex Setup**: Setting up the API can be cumbersome, especially for one-off or small-scale projects.

## How Does Amazon2CSV Work?

Unlike API-based solutions, Amazon2CSV uses web scraping to retrieve product data directly from Amazon's HTML structure. This method has its advantages:

- **No Affiliate Program Needed**: No reliance on Amazon's affiliate program to maintain API access.
- **No API Rate Limits**: Bypass the low rate limits of the API.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Works well for one-time or recurring scraping needs.

However, web scraping does come with its challenges, such as:

- **IP Bans and Rate Limiting**: Amazon may block your IP if it detects unusual activity.
- **Page Layout Changes**: Amazon frequently changes its page layouts, which may require updates to the scraper.
