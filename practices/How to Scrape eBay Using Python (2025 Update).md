## Why Scrape eBay?

eBay is a diverse marketplace, offering everything from rare collectibles to cutting-edge tech devices. This makes it a rich source of data for e-commerce professionals and researchers. Common use cases for scraping eBay include:

- **Competitor Analysis:** Gather data on competitors' pricing, sales, and reviews.
- **Market Research:** Monitor trends, identify hot deals, and track niche markets.
- **Automated Alerts:** Set up custom notifications for product searches and pricing.

## Setup and Requirements

### Key Python Libraries

For scraping eBay, weâ€™ll use the following Python libraries:

1. **[httpx](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/):** For sending HTTP requests and handling eBayâ€™s responses.
2. **[parsel](https://pypi.org/project/parsel/):** For parsing HTML with XPath or CSS selectors.
3. **[nested-lookup](https://pypi.org/project/nested-lookup/):** For extracting nested JSON data.

Install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install httpx[http2] parsel nested_lookup
```

Alternatively, you can replace `httpx` with `requests` and `parsel` with `BeautifulSoup` if preferred.

## Scraping eBay Listings

eBay product listings generally fall into two categories:

1. **Single Variant Listings:** Products with fixed options (e.g., books, household items).
2. **Multiple Variant Listings:** Products with multiple configurations (e.g., tech devices with different storage capacities).

Weâ€™ll start with scraping single variant listings, as theyâ€™re simpler to process.

### Example: Parsing a Single Listing

Hereâ€™s a Python snippet to scrape product details from an eBay listing:

```python
import httpx
from parsel import Selector

# Configure an HTTP client
session = httpx.Client(
    headers={
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/113.0.1774.35",
        "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8",
    },
    follow_redirects=True
)

def parse_product(response: httpx.Response):
    sel = Selector(response.text)
    product = {
        "url": sel.css("link[rel='canonical']::attr(href)").get(),
        "title": sel.css("h1 span::text").get(),
        "price": sel.css(".x-price-primary span::text").get(),
        "seller": sel.css("div.info__about-seller a span::text").get(),
        "photos": sel.css(".ux-image-carousel-item img::attr(src)").getall(),
    }
    return product

# Example usage
response = session.get("https://www.ebay.com/itm/332562282948")
product_data = parse_product(response)
print(product_data)
```

## Scraping eBay Search Pages

eBayâ€™s search functionality uses a URL structure with parameters to control query results. For example:

- `_nkw`: Search keyword (e.g., `iphone`).
- `_sacat`: Category restriction.
- `_pgn`: Page number.
- `_ipg`: Items per page (default is 60).

### Example: Scraping Search Results

Hereâ€™s a script to scrape product previews from search results:

```python
import httpx
from parsel import Selector

def parse_search(response):
    sel = Selector(response.text)
    listings = sel.css(".srp-results .s-item")
    results = []
    for item in listings:
        results.append({
            "title": item.css(".s-item__title span::text").get(),
            "price": item.css(".s-item__price::text").get(),
            "url": item.css("a.s-item__link::attr(href)").get(),
        })
    return results

response = httpx.get("https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=iphone&_pgn=1")
search_results = parse_search(response)
print(search_results)
```

## Avoiding Scraping Blocks

Scraping eBay at scale requires extra precautions to avoid detection. eBay employs anti-bot mechanisms, including CAPTCHAs and IP bans.

### How to Avoid Blocks

1. **User-Agent Rotation:** Mimic different browsers.
2. **IP Rotation:** Use proxies to avoid IP bans.
3. **Rate Limiting:** Slow down requests to appear as a regular user.

Alternatively, use **ScraperAPI** to bypass these challenges effortlessly.
