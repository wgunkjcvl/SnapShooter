## Setting Up Your Etsy Scraper

Weâ€™ll use the following Python libraries for scraping Etsy:

- `httpx`: Sends HTTP requests and retrieves HTML.
- `parsel`: Parses data from HTML using XPath or CSS selectors.
- `loguru`: Logs and monitors scraper performance.
- `asyncio`: Enables asynchronous scraping for faster execution.
- `scrapfly-sdk`: Helps bypass Etsyâ€™s anti-scraping protections.

To install these libraries, run:

```bash
pip install httpx parsel loguru scrapfly-sdk
```

## Scraping Etsy Listings

Listing pages on Etsy provide product information that can be extracted directly in JSON format. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Open any [Etsy listing page](https://www.etsy.com/listing/949905096).
2. Use your browserâ€™s developer tools (F12) to locate the `<script>` tag with `application/ld+json`. This contains the structured product data.

### Example Output
```json
{
  "@type": "Product",
  "url": "https://www.etsy.com/listing/949905096/oakywood-dual-laptop-stand-wood-vertical",
  "name": "Oakywood Dual Laptop Stand",
  "description": "The Dual Laptop Dock is an innovative solution...",
  "image": [
    "https://i.etsystatic.com/13285848/r/il/ea7b26/4369079578/il_fullxfull.4369079578_p74k.jpg"
  ],
  "offers": {
    "lowPrice": "70.00",
    "highPrice": "80.00",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "ratingValue": "4.9",
    "reviewCount": 7695
  }
}
```

By extracting this JSON data, you can easily retrieve product details like name, price, images, and reviews.

## Scraping Etsy Shops

Shop pages on Etsy include information about products, reviews, and the shop itself. Similar to listing pages, this data can also be found in `<script>` tags.

Use Python libraries like `httpx` and `parsel` to extract shop data. For example:

```python
def parse_shop_page(response):
    selector = Selector(response.text)
    script = selector.xpath("//script[contains(text(),'itemListElement')]/text()").get()
    return json.loads(script)
```

### Example Output
```json
{
  "@type": "Store",
  "name": "Oakywood",
  "description": "Handcrafted wooden accessories for your workspace...",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "ratingValue": "4.9",
    "reviewCount": 7695
  },
  "offers": {
    "lowPrice": "70.00",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}
```

## Scraping Etsy Search Pages

Search pages on Etsy contain multiple product listings. However, the `<script>` tags on these pages often only reveal partial data. To scrape all products, you need to parse the HTML and extract listings.

Hereâ€™s how you can scrape search pages:

1. Use a library like `parsel` to extract product data directly from the HTML structure.
2. Handle pagination to scrape additional search result pages.

### Example Code
```python
async def scrape_search(url):
    response = await client.get(url)
    selector = Selector(response.text)
    data = []
    for product in selector.xpath("//li[contains(@class, 'v2-listing-card')]"):
        data.append({
            "title": product.xpath(".//h3/text()").get(),
            "price": product.xpath(".//span[@class='currency-value']/text()").get(),
            "link": product.xpath(".//a/@href").get()
        })
    return data
```

- Proxy rotation to avoid detection.
- JavaScript rendering for scraping dynamic content.
- Country-based targeting for localized results.

### Example with ScraperAPI
```python
from scrapfly import ScrapeConfig, ScrapflyClient

scrapfly_client = ScrapflyClient("Your API Key")
result = scrapfly_client.scrape(ScrapeConfig(
    url="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=handmade+gifts",
    asp=True,
    render_js=True
))
```
