# A Comprehensive Guide to How Google Search Works

Google Search is a fully automated search engine that uses software known as "web crawlers" to regularly explore the internet and discover web pages to add to the Google index. Most pages included in Google Search results are not manually submitted but are found and added automatically as our crawlers explore the web. This document outlines the various stages of how Google Search works from a website perspective. Understanding these basics can help you resolve crawling issues, get your pages indexed, and improve your website's presentation in Google Search results.

## Key Considerations Before You Begin

Before diving deeper into how Google Search operates, it is important to note:

1. Google does not charge fees to increase your website's crawling frequency or ranking. Any claim to the contrary is false.
2. Even if your web pages comply with [Google Search Essentials](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials?hl=en), there is no guarantee that Google will crawl, index, or display your pages in search results.

## The Three Key Stages of Google Search

Google Search operates in three stages, though not every page necessarily goes through all three:

1. **[Crawling](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/how-search-works?hl=en#crawling):** Discovering pages on the internet using automated programs known as crawlers.
2. **[Indexing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/how-search-works?hl=en#indexing):** Analyzing and storing the content of these pages in Google's massive database, the Google Index.
3. **[Serving Search Results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/how-search-works?hl=en#serving):** Delivering relevant and quality results when users perform a search query.

### Crawling

The first stage involves discovering what web pages exist on the internet. Since there is no central registry of all web pages, Google constantly searches for new and updated pages to add to its list of known pages, a process referred to as "URL discovery." Hereâ€™s how Google discovers new pages:

- Following links on known pages to discover new ones, such as category pages that link to new blog posts.
- Using submitted lists of URLs in the form of [sitemaps](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview?hl=en).

Once Google discovers a page's URL, it may visit or "crawl" the page to learn more about its content. Google employs automated systems to crawl billions of pages on the web, using programs called [Googlebot](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot?hl=en), also referred to as crawlers, spiders, or bots.

Googlebot uses an algorithmic process to decide which websites to crawl, how often, and how many pages to fetch from each website. To ensure it doesnâ€™t overwhelm your website, Googlebot adjusts its crawling rate based on your site's response (e.g., [HTTP 500 errors](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/http-network-errors?hl=en) indicate to "slow down").

However, Googlebot doesnâ€™t crawl every page it finds. Some pages might be blocked from crawling using a [robots.txt file](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/robots_txt?hl=en), while others require login credentials to access.

During crawling, Google renders pages using the latest version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and runs any JavaScript it finds. This process is essential because websites often rely on JavaScript to load content into their pages, which Google may not see without rendering.

### Indexing

Once a page is crawled, Google attempts to understand its content. This stage, known as "indexing," involves processing and analyzing the text, images, and video files on the page, as well as critical elements like the `<title>` tag, alt attributes, and structured data.

During indexing, Google determines whether a page:

- Is a duplicate or canonical version of other pages found on the web.
- Contains language and metadata indicating its relevance to users in a specific region or language.

The gathered information is stored in Googleâ€™s large database, known as the Google Index, which spans thousands of servers. However, not every page Google processes is included in the index. Whether a page is indexed depends on its content, metadata, and other factors.

### Serving Search Results

When a user performs a search query, Google retrieves matching pages from the index and ranks them based on relevance. Factors like the userâ€™s location, language, and device (desktop or mobile) influence which results are shown.

For example, searching for "bike repair shop" will yield different results for a user in Paris versus someone in Hong Kong. Additionally, search features displayed on the results page vary depending on the query. Searching for "bike repair shop" might show local search results, while searching for "modern bikes" could prioritize image search results.

Google continuously updates its algorithms to improve search quality. Stay informed about these updates by following the [Google Search Central Blog](https://developers.google.com/search/blog?hl=en).
