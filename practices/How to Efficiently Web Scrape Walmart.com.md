## Setting Up Your Walmart Scraper

### Step 1: Create a New Project Folder

First, set up your working environment by creating a new folder and file:

```bash
$ mkdir walmart_scraper
$ cd walmart_scraper
$ touch walmart_scraper.py
```

### Step 2: Install Necessary Libraries

Youâ€™ll need two Python libraries: `Requests` to fetch web pages and `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML content. Install them using:

```bash
$ pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Fetching Walmart Product Pages

To start, weâ€™ll fetch the Walmart product page HTML. Write the following code in your `walmart_scraper.py` file:

```python
import requests

url = "https://www.walmart.com/ip/HP-11-6-Chromebook-AMD-A4-4GB-RAM-32GB-Storage-Black-16W64UT-ABA/592161882"
html = requests.get(url)

print(html.text)
```

If the HTML contains a CAPTCHA response, add a `User-Agent` header to mimic a real browser:

```python
headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:104.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/104.0"}
html = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

---

## Extracting Product Information

With the HTML fetched, we can now parse it to extract product details like:

- **Product Name**  
- **Price**  
- **Images**  
- **Description**

Hereâ€™s an example for extracting the product name using BeautifulSoup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(html.text, 'html.parser')
product_name = soup.find('h1', attrs={'itemprop': 'name'}).text

print(product_name)
```

To extract other details, repeat the process:

- **Price:** Look for `<span>` tags with the `itemprop="price"` attribute.  
- **Images:** Extract image URLs from `<div>` tags with `data-testid="media-thumbnail"`.  
- **Description:** Extract content from JSON data within the `<script>` tag (`__NEXT_DATA__`).

## Using ScrapingBee for Walmart Scraping

Walmart employs advanced anti-scraping measures like CAPTCHAs and IP blocks. To bypass these challenges, ScrapingBee is an excellent solution. ScrapingBee automatically handles:

- Rotating proxies.  
- Solving CAPTCHAs.  
- Fetching dynamic JavaScript content.

### Setting Up ScrapingBee

1. Install the ScrapingBee Python SDK:

```bash
$ pip install scrapingbee
```

2. Register for an API key on the [ScrapingBee website](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi).  

3. Use ScrapingBee in your script:

```python
from scrapingbee import ScrapingBeeClient

client = ScrapingBeeClient(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

response = client.get(url, params={"render_js": "true"})
html = response.content

print(html)
```

ScrapingBee ensures your scraper is efficient, secure, and unblocked.

## Handling JSON Data in Walmart Pages

Walmart uses `Next.js` to dynamically load product data into a JSON object within the `<script>` tag. Use BeautifulSoup to extract and parse this JSON:

```python
import json

script_tag = soup.find('script', attrs={'id': '__NEXT_DATA__'})
parsed_json = json.loads(script_tag.string)

description = parsed_json['props']['pageProps']['initialData']['data']['product']['shortDescription']
print(description)
```

This method ensures accurate and comprehensive data extraction.
