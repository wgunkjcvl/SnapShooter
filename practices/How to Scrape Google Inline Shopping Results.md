## How to Scrape Google Shopping Inline Results

Scraping Google Shopping inline results can be done using multiple tools and programming languages. Below are some essential steps and best practices for efficient scraping:

### 1. Understand the Page Structure

- Analyze the HTML structure of the Google Shopping inline results.
- Identify key elements such as product titles, prices, images, and links.

### 2. Choose the Right Tools

- Use libraries like **BeautifulSoup** (Python) or **Cheerio** (Node.js) for parsing HTML.
- Consider using headless browsers like **Puppeteer** or **Selenium** for dynamic content.

### 3. Manage Proxies and CAPTCHAs

- Avoid IP bans by rotating proxies and solving CAPTCHAs automatically.
- Leverage tools like **ScraperAPI** for proxy management and CAPTCHA handling.

### 4. Code Example (Node.js)

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to scrape Google Shopping inline results with Node.js:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');

async function scrapeGoogleShopping(query) {
    const url = `https://www.google.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    const $ = cheerio.load(response.data);

    const products = [];
    $('.sh-dgr__grid-result').each((index, element) => {
        const title = $(element).find('.sh-dgr__content').text();
        const price = $(element).find('.a8Pemb').text();
        const link = $(element).find('a').attr('href');
        products.push({ title, price, link });
    });

    console.log(products);
}

scrapeGoogleShopping('laptops');
```

### 5. Handle Rate Limits

To avoid being blocked:

- Use randomized request intervals.
- Implement proper error handling for HTTP response codes like 429 (Too Many Requests).
