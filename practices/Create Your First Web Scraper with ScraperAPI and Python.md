## How to Use ScraperAPI with Python

ScraperAPI supports all major programming languages, but for this tutorial, we‚Äôll focus on Python using the `requests` library.

### Getting Started

1. **Sign Up for ScraperAPI**  
   Start by signing up on their [official website](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi). You‚Äôll receive an API key upon registration, which allows you to make 1,000 free API calls to test their platform.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python and the `requests` library installed. If not, install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Basic Example**  
   Use the following code to make a simple request with ScraperAPI:

   ```python
   import requests

   API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
   URL = 'https://httpbin.org/ip'

   response = requests.get(f'http://api.scraperapi.com', params={
       'api_key': API_KEY,
       'url': URL
   })

   print(response.text)
   ```

   Every time you run this script, ScraperAPI returns a new IP address, thanks to its dynamic IP rotation.

### Advanced Features

#### Persistent Sessions
If you need to mimic a single user session across multiple requests, you can use the `session_number` parameter:

```python
response = requests.get(f'http://api.scraperapi.com', params={
    'api_key': API_KEY,
    'url': URL,
    'session_number': 12345
})
```

This ensures the same proxy IP is used for all requests within the session.

#### JavaScript Rendering
For JavaScript-heavy websites, enable rendering with the `render=true` parameter:

```python
response = requests.get(f'http://api.scraperapi.com', params={
    'api_key': API_KEY,
    'url': URL,
    'render': 'true'
})
```

## Creating an OLX Scraper

Let‚Äôs create a simple scraper for OLX to demonstrate ScraperAPI‚Äôs capabilities. The following script extracts prices from OLX listings:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
BASE_URL = 'https://www.olx.in/'

def scrape_olx():
    response = requests.get(f'http://api.scraperapi.com', params={
        'api_key': API_KEY,
        'url': BASE_URL
    })
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    # Extract prices
    prices = soup.find_all('span', class_='price')
    for price in prices:
        print(price.text)

scrape_olx()
```

For detailed parsing, refer to other tutorials on using **BeautifulSoup**.
