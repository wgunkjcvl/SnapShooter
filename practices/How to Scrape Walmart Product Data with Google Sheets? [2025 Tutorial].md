## Step-by-Step Tutorial to Scrape Walmart Product Data in Google Sheets

To extract Walmart data, we‚Äôll use the **ImportFromWeb** add-on. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install and Activate ImportFromWeb

1. Install **ImportFromWeb** from the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/importfromweb_web_scraping_in_google_she/278587576794).  
2. Activate it in a new Google Sheets file (via the Extensions menu).

ImportFromWeb uses a simple Google Sheets formula, `=IMPORTFROMWEB()`, which requires two parameters:  
- The Walmart listing URL  
- The data selectors (e.g., product title, price, reviews, etc.)

### Step 2: Input Walmart Product URLs

Copy and paste your list of Walmart product URLs into the first column of your spreadsheet.

### Step 3: Define Data Points to Extract

Determine the data points you want to extract (e.g., titles, prices, ratings, and reviews). Write the corresponding selectors in the first row of your spreadsheet. For example:

- **title**
- **price**
- **ratings**
- **reviews_count**

### Step 4: Use the =IMPORTFROMWEB() Function

Enter the following formula in cell `B2`:

```plaintext
=IMPORTFROMWEB(A2,B1:E1)
```

This formula retrieves the data from Walmart and presents it in a structured table format. To apply the formula to all rows, adjust it with ‚Äú$‚Äù for the selectors and drag it down:

```plaintext
=IMPORTFROMWEB(A2,$B$1:$E$1)
```

### Step 5: Regularly Update Data

Walmart data (e.g., prices, ratings) may change frequently. ImportFromWeb ensures your Google Sheets stay synchronized with real-time data. Simply re-execute the formulas to refresh your dashboard.
